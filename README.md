*A library loader in Roblox Luau with lazy-loader compatibility and packaged with efficient libraries.*

## [Read the documentation!](https://mullets-gavin.github.io/Loader/)

Loader is, at itâ€™s finest, a Roblox Luau library loader with some sweet built-in libraries. Loader aims to replace the require function within your game. By doing so, this allows you to lazy load modules, which means you can require modules by name like `require("Module")` & deep search your DataModel for that script.
